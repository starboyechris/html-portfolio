<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Oh....You want to know more about me?</p>

<p>My name is Chris Todd! I was born and raised in San Diego California. I've done quite a bit of traveling inside the US but nothing beats sunny San Diego.</p>

<p>I fell in love with coding back in 2023 but finally decided to dive in headfirst in 2025. I may be a beginner as this is my first site, but I have a drive like no other and commit myself to building the best websites I can. </p>

<p>Thank you for checking out my page and I hope to work with you soon!</p>
